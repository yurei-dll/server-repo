# server-repo
Contains All the things needed to join the server at `yureidll.ddns.net`, assuming you've been whitelisted.

## Basic server info:
We're running Minecraft `1.20.1`, on `Java 17`, Forge version `47.2.0`. 

## Prerequisites
First, make sure your computer has all the things listed above. I highly recomend using a launcher like Prism or Curseforge, it'll make this a whole lot easier. Otherwise, you'll have to manually download over 100 mods... A simple list of mods can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yurei-dll/server-repo/main/modlist.json) if thats what you need, or if you have some other way of automating it.

## How to install?

### If you're using a custom launcher:
- Find out which zip file you need depending on the Launcher you're using.
- *Custom modpack files will be shared privately. So continue once you get ahold of one*
- Go to your launcher, import the `zip`/`modpack` file. There is no need to extract it!

### If you're using the real launcher
- Run the game with all the prerequisites, to confirm it launches and creates a `mods/` folder in your `.minecraft` folder.
- Download all the needed mods from [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EwK6wKfp4-o6lEFc7oYJxp0cpoYVpf19)
- Put all the `.jar` files into the `mods/` folder. If it wasn't created for some reason, its ok to create it manually.
- *Be aware you'll likely need to increase the amount of RAM minecraft can use, and switch `Java` to use your high power graphics card.*
- Confirm all the mods have loaded after launching the game and clicking the mods button.
